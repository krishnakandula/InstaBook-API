# InstaBook-API
InstaBook-API is the service that powers the InstaBook Android application. This service stores and provides books and other meta-data consumed by the app. The API was created with NodeJs, ExpressJs, and MongoDb and is hosted using Heroku. All of the books used were taken from Project Gutenberg.

1. See the author, title, and sample page of a random book
2. Receive information for any number of random books 
3. View the cover image of a book given the id
4. Post your own book information and image
5. Delete the information of an existing book
